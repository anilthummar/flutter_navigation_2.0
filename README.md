**Differences Between Normal Navigation (Navigator 1.0) and Navigator 2.0**

**Navigator 1.0 (Imperative Navigation)**
**Imperative Approach:** You directly call methods like Navigator.push() and Navigator.pop() to manipulate the navigation stack.
**Simple API:** Suitable for straightforward navigation use cases.
**Limited Control:** Handling back button behavior, deep linking, and custom routing logic is more cumbersome.
**No Direct URL Handling:** Not directly tied to the browser's URL bar in web applications, making deep linking and SEO more challenging.

**Navigator 2.0 (Declarative Navigation)**
**Declarative Approach:** You define the navigation stack as a list of Page objects. The framework updates the UI based on the differences between the current and previous states.
**State Synchronization:** The navigation stack is directly tied to the application state, enabling more complex and dynamic routing.
**Enhanced Control:** Provides more control over back button handling, deep linking, and custom routing logic.
**URL Handling:** Integrates well with web URL handling, making it easier to implement deep linking and respond to changes in the browser's URL bar.
